# Assessing water cycle processes across scales (hk25-MountainWaterCycle)

This activity is motivated by several open questions on how the mountainous water cycle processes (e.g., precipitation, snowpack, and runoff) converge/diverge across scales 2 km - 200 km. For instance, how does precipitation efficiency respond to changing resolutions of orography?  Which mountains around the world have the highest/lowest precipitation efficiency?  What are the windward/leeward precipitation ratios across mountains of the world?  How does snowmelt and runoff rates (and runoff efficiency) respond across resolutions?

Coordination: Alan Rhoades (arhoades@lbl.gov)

First activities may include:
* Mask mountainous regions around the world across multiple resolutions/zoom settings
* Derive precipitation efficiency/drying ratios (precipitation/IWV) across multiple resolutions/zoom settings
* Derive windward/leeward ratios of annual precipitation totals
* Derive snow fraction of annual precipitation totals
* Derive annual runoff totals and runoff efficiency (runoff/precipitation)
