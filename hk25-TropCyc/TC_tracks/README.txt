## TC Tracks from TempestExtremes and SyCLoPS

Please upload in this folder ONE csv file containing all the TC points for each simulation you have tracked (the output of StitchNodes)

10 May 2025 update: we have added TE tracks from both hemispheres. SyCLoPS tracks are, temporarily, only for the NH, but will be amended soon.

Please give to the file the name of your simulation with .csv
